      "Shopify Summit 2025 brought together 6,500 Shopify employees for a four-day internal event in Toronto, centered around innovation, hackathons, and team connection. Nearly 2,000 additional attendees joined across the street for Editions.dev, a separate but concurrently supported event for Shopify platform users. Despite being distinct experiences, both events shared the same underlying network infrastructure, supporting nearly 8,500 users across multiple buildings — all delivered through a unified, high-performance UniFi network deployment.",
